ðŸŒˆ JavaFX Light and Dark CSS Themes ðŸŒ™

Two distinct CSS files â€“ one for a bright, light theme and the other for a sleek, dark theme. These CSS files have been written for my JavaFX project and do not cover everything.

Features:

    ðŸŒž Light Theme: A clean and bright visual style for a refreshing user experience.
    ðŸŒš Dark Theme: A sleek and sophisticated dark theme that's easy on the eyes, perfect for low-light environments.
    ðŸŽ¨ Customizable: Effortlessly integrate these CSS files into your JavaFX project and customize as needed.
    ðŸš€ Easy Integration: Seamless integration with JavaFX applications â€“ just link the preferred CSS file, and you're ready to go!
